This API was made for public use for the purpose of nif querying. 
Happy or unfortunately the api was made in Graphql and has a fairly simple query form with just one query.

### Before to run: 

- Change .env.example to .env
- It is free to make changes or contribute

The graphql already has its documentation integrated into the playground, 
just look and see, has the form of consultation quite simple, as you see in the illustration.
